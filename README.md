<p> - Semantic search (not convert text into embeddings and apply an ANN, but actual semantic search like how a human recites a book)</p>

<p> - Working around context windows on local LLMs (better than the 8k afforded by the superHOT RoPE hack)

<p> - Prompt engineering for user customization</p>

<p> - Fine tuning LLMs for replicating Q&A style conversations</p>

<p> - Authentic TTS, or even STS  :eyes:</p>

<p> - Optimizing mediums of information for knowledge/language acquisition</p>

<p>I'm also building a couple of AI business tools like Q&A bots, document interpreters and disseminators at TReNDS Center</p>
